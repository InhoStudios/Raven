# Raven by Affinity

Using AdHawk eye tracing technology, we developed a product that is able to follow a user's eye movement and convert the text they see into audio that is played back to the user.

This technology is aimed towards users with learning disabilities, reduced vision and those who are learning a language. It is suitable for users of all demographics.

Raven implements eye tracing with optical character recognition (OCR) and text to speech automation.
